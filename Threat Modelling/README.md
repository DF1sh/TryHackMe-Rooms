# Threat Modelling

### Threat Modelling Overview
- What is a weakness or flaw in a system, application, or process that can be exploited by a threat? `vulnerability`
- Based on the provided high-level methodology, what is the process of developing diagrams to visualise the organisation's architecture and dependencies? `Asset Identification`
- What diagram describes and analyses potential threats against a system or application? `attack tree`

### Modelling with MITRE ATT&CK
- What is the technique ID of "Exploit Public-Facing Application"? `T1190`
- Under what tactic does this technique belong? `Initial Access`

### Mapping with ATT&CK Navigator
- How many MITRE ATT&CK techniques are attributed to APT33?<br />

`31`
- Upon applying the IaaS platform filter, how many techniques are under the Discovery tactic? `13`

### DREAD Framework
- What DREAD component assesses the potential harm from successfully exploiting a vulnerability? `Damage`
- What DREAD component evaluates how others can easily find and identify the vulnerability? `Discoverability`
- Which DREAD component considers the number of impacted users when a vulnerability is exploited? `Affected Users`

### STRIDE Framework
- What foundational information security concept does the STRIDE framework build upon? `CIA Triad`
- What policy does Information Disclosure violate? `confidentiality`
- Which STRIDE component involves unauthorised modification or manipulation of data? `Tampering`
- Which STRIDE component refers to the disruption of the system's availability? `Denial of Service`
- Provide the flag for the simulated threat modelling exercise. `THM{m0d3ll1ng_w1th_STR1D3}`

### PASTA Framework
- In which step of the framework do you break down the system into its components? `Decompose the Application`
- During which step of the PASTA framework do you simulate potential attack scenarios? `Analyse the Attacks`
- In which step of the PASTA framework do you create an inventory of assets? `Define the Technical Scope`
- Provide the flag for the simulated threat modelling exercise. `THM{c00k1ng_thr34ts_w_P4ST4}`
