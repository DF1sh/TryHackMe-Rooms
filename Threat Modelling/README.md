# Threat Modelling

### Threat Modelling Overview
- What is a weakness or flaw in a system, application, or process that can be exploited by a threat? `vulnerability`
- Based on the provided high-level methodology, what is the process of developing diagrams to visualise the organisation's architecture and dependencies? `Asset Identification`
- What diagram describes and analyses potential threats against a system or application? `attack tree`

### Modelling with MITRE ATT&CK
- What is the technique ID of "Exploit Public-Facing Application"?
- Under what tactic does this technique belong?

### Mapping with ATT&CK Navigator
- How many MITRE ATT&CK techniques are attributed to APT33?
- Upon applying the IaaS platform filter, how many techniques are under the Discovery tactic?

### DREAD Framework
- What DREAD component assesses the potential harm from successfully exploiting a vulnerability?
- What DREAD component evaluates how others can easily find and identify the vulnerability?
- Which DREAD component considers the number of impacted users when a vulnerability is exploited?

### STRIDE Framework
- What foundational information security concept does the STRIDE framework build upon?
- What policy does Information Disclosure violate?
- Which STRIDE component involves unauthorised modification or manipulation of data?
- Which STRIDE component refers to the disruption of the system's availability?
- Provide the flag for the simulated threat modelling exercise.

### PASTA Framework
- In which step of the framework do you break down the system into its components?
- During which step of the PASTA framework do you simulate potential attack scenarios?
- In which step of the PASTA framework do you create an inventory of assets?
- Provide the flag for the simulated threat modelling exercise.
