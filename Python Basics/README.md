# Python Basics

### Hello World 
- On the code editor, print "Hello World". What is the flag? `THM{PRINT_STATEMENTS}` <br />

### Mathematical Operators
- In the code editor, print the result of 21 + 43. What is the flag? `THM{ADDITI0N}` <br />
- Print the result of 142 - 52. What is the flag? `THM{SUBTRCT}` <br />
- Print the result of 10 * 342. What is the flag? `THM{MULTIPLICATION_PYTHON}` <br />
- Print the result of 5 squared. What is the flag? `THM{EXP0N3NT_POWER}` <br />

### Variables and Data Types
- On another new line, print out the value of height. What is the flag that appears? `THM{VARIABL3S}` <br />

### Introduction to If Statements
- Once you've written the application in the code editor's shipping.py tab, a flag will appear, which is the answer to this question. `THM{IF_STATEMENT_SHOPPING}` <br />
- In shipping.py, on line 12 (when using the Code Editor's Hint), change the customer_basket_cost variable to 101 and re-run your code. You will get a flag (if the total cost is correct based on your code); the flag is the answer to this question. `THM{MY_FIRST_APP}` <br />


### Loops
- On the code editor, click back on the "script.py" tab and code a loop that outputs every number from 0 to 50. `THM{L00PS_WHILE_FOR}` <br />

###  Introduction to Functions
- Once you've written the bitcoinToUSD function, use it to calculate the value of your Bitcoin in USD, and then create an if statement to determine if the value falls below $30,000; if it does, output a message to alert you (via a print statement). `THM{BITC0IN_INVESTOR}` <br />

### Files
- In the code editor, write Python code to read the flag.txt file. What is the flag in this file? `THM{F1LE_R3AD}` <br />
