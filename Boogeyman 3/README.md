`"C:\Windows\System32\xcopy.exe" /s /i /e /h D:\review.dat C:\Users\EVAN~1.HUT\AppData\Local\Temp\review.dat`
- The implanted file was eventually used and executed by the stage 1 payload. What is the full command-line value of this execution?<br />
Search for `D:\review.dat*`:<br />

- The attacker has discovered that the current access is a local administrator. What is the name of the process used by the attacker to execute a UAC bypass?<br />
User Account Control (UAC) bypass is a technique used by attackers to gain elevated privileges on a Windows system without triggering a UAC prompt. UAC is a security feature in Windows designed to prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system by requiring administrator approval before executing actions that could affect the systemâ€™s security or functionality.<br />

- Using the new credentials, the attacker attempted to enumerate accessible file shares. What is the name of the file accessed by the attacker from a remote share?<br />
- After getting the contents of the remote file, the attacker used the new credentials to move laterally. What is the new set of credentials discovered by the attacker? (format: username:password)<br />
- What is the hostname of the attacker's target machine for its lateral movement attempt?<br />
- Using the malicious command executed by the attacker from the first machine to move laterally, what is the parent process name of the malicious command executed on the second compromised machine?<br />
- The attacker then dumped the hashes in this second machine. What is the username and hash of the newly dumped credentials? (format: username:hash)<br />
