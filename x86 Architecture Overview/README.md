# x86 Architecture Overview

### CPU architecture overview
- In which part of the Von Neumann architecture are the code and data required for a program to run stored? `Memory`
- What part of the CPU stores small amounts of data? `Registers`
- In which unit are arithmetic operations performed? `Arithmetic Logic Unit`

### Registers overview
- Which register holds the address to the next instruction that is to be executed? `Instruction Pointer`
- Which register in a 32-bit system is also called the Counter Register? `ECX`
- Which registers from the ones discussed above are not present in a 32-bit system? `R8-R15`
 
### Registers - Continued
- Which flag is used by the program to identify if it is being run in a debugger? `Trap Flag`
- Which flag will be set when the most significant bit in an operation is set to 1? `Sign Flag`
- Which Segment register contains the pointer to the code section in memory? `Code Segment`

### Memory overview
- When a program is loaded into Memory, does it have a full view of the system memory? Y or N? `N`
- Which section of the Memory contains the code? `Code`
- Which Memory section contains information related to the program's control flow? `Stack`

### Stack Layout
