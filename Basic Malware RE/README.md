### Strings :: Challenge 1
For these challenges I'm using IDA to anaylze the binaries. For the first one, there's the flag in the code. Was very easy:<br />

`FLAG{CAN-I-MAKE-IT-ANYMORE-OBVIOUS}`

### Strings :: Challenge 2
Again, flag is hardcoded in memory, it's just not sequential:<br />

### Strings 3 :: Challenge 3
This file calls `FindResourceA` to retrieve some data contained in the .rsrc section of the file (This is a PE file):<br />

At this point I didn't know how to retrieve the data inside the .rsrc section from kali linux...:<br />
So I downloaded the file on my windows machine and used `Resource Hacker` to view it.<br />

But there are a lot of flags in here.. How do I find the right one? Here I put some comments to make it clearer:<br />

The Shfit Left operation is essentially multiplying by 2 the argument every time. Since in eax it is doing it 8 times, it's like doing 2^7 = 256. Same thing for edx but 4 times, so it's 16. It then does an OR operation between the two. The output of this operation is 272.<br />
Then it loads the string with ID = 272. So the flag is number 272:<br />
