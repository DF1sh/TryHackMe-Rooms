### It's-a-me!

Initial nmap scan shows port 85 open:

    nmap -sC -sV -p85 10.10.137.9                 
    Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-10-04 12:58 EDT
    Nmap scan report for 10.10.137.9
    Host is up (0.054s latency).

Gobuster directory enumeration shows /app directory, which eventually leads me to `http://10.10.137.9:85/app/castle/`<br />

As you can see from the image above, Wappalyzer shows that this server is running `Concrete CMS 8.5.2`. After some online search and website enumeration, I found the following page `http://10.10.137.9:85/app/castle/index.php/login`:<br />

I saw online that the default username for the admin is `admin.` So I tried with `admin:password`, and it worked, lol. Now I can exploit a vulnerability that i found [here](https://hackerone.com/reports/768322). Follow the steps provided in this guide:<br />
Add .php in the allowed file types: <br />

Now generate a php revershe shell. Personally I used the one from PentestMonkey, provided in the `rev.php` file of this repo.<br />
Now upload it:<br />

Now open a netcat listener and click on the created link: <br />

Nice(flags are at the end of this writeup): <br />

Now [stabilize the shell](https://maxat-akbanov.com/how-to-stabilize-a-simple-reverse-shell-to-a-fully-interactive-terminal) so that you can keep you mental sanity. 
Next, I run linpeas.sh on the target system to check any privesc paths. First thing I noticed is that /bin/cat has the SUID bit set, but I wasn't able to exploit it. Next, I found credentials for a mysql DB running on the target machine: <br />

To log inside the DB, the command is `mysql -u toad -p -h localhost`, and then input the discovered password. However, before logging in the DB, I wanted to try if that password also worked for toad's accout, so I run `su toad`, provided the password, and it worked. However I wasn't able to find anything from toad's account besides one thing: the .mysql_history file showed me a hint: <br />

There must be a `user` table with some data in it. Inside the mKingdom database I was able to find a `Users` table, only to find that the password of the admin account is `password`, which I already knew. What I'm looking for is a way to access root. Instead I found a `user` table inside the `mysql` database. <br />

I already know toad's password.  Let's try to break debian-sys-maint password. Nope, nothing. I can't do it. Whatching again linpeas output I found a weird environment variable: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42f38c36-b3fc-455b-9616-b7e7b43e0c38)<br />
This base64 encoded value is `ikaTeNTANtES`, and it turns out to be the password for Mario. Thus I finally got the first flag(with nano, cat doens't work). <br />
Running `sudo -l` on mario, this is what we find: <br />
